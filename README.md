gradle-playground
=================

A bunch of small projects exploring the capabilities of Gradle in comparison to Maven.

hello-world
-----------

The most simple Gradle project. Just execute `gradle helloWorld` to run it. Have a look at the `build.gradle`. Run `gradle world` to execute the most simple multi-task build.

java-library
------------

An example of a simple Java library bootstrapped with `gradle init --type java-library`.

Run `gradle build` (or `./gradlew build` if you want to use the wrapper) to build the project.
